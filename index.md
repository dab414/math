# Resources for Learning Math

## Objective

This is a space that I'm dedicating to learning types of math that would be of benefit for
the type of work that I'm doing / I'm interested in doing. I'd like to move toward a true
mastery of statistics, probability, and modeling generally, and so the following course
seems the most beneficial toward this aim.

I'm making this directory public in the hopes that documenting my math adventures might be
of benefit to others.

## Approach

I see probability theory as being a foundation upon which the other types of math I'm
interested rest, so my primary aim will be to start by trying to really grasp probability
theory. I see the major prerequisites of probability theory being calculus and linear
algebra. I'll start with calculus, move to linear algebra, then to probability theory and
beyond.

### Progress

**Step 1: Learn single variable calculus**

* Get a foundation in real analysis
    * Work through Chapter 1 of Abbott's *Understanding Analysis*
        * See [notes](real-analysis/abbott_notes.pdf)
* Work through Spivak's *Calculus* concurrently with taking the MIT open course on [single
    variable
    calculus.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/syllabus/)

**Step 2: Learn multivariable calculus**

**Step 3: Learn linear algebra**

**Step 4: Learn probability theory**
