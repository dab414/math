    need to figure out what the game plan will be here
    
    it looks like the course starts around ch 3 of spivak
    need to be very conscious of the depth vs breadth balance 

    might be helpful to make a more concrete schedule
        where i want to be in a certain course by what date

    so like the course is just a typical semester course
        so imagine 2-3 lectures a week, plus engaging with practice problems on off days

    39 (what im assuming are) hour long videos
        2 / week = 19.5 weeks
        3 / week = 13 weeks
            ^ the only way to reasonably try to cover the material in a summer

    so i think for week 0 (this week), try to get through part one of spivak
        also ch1 of abbott
